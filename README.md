**Please note:** Blackthorn 3D is no longer under active development,
and the code is mostly of historical interest only.

Blackthorn 3D is a game engine written in Common Lisp.
[Check out the wiki for more information](https://bitbucket.org/elliottslaughter/blackthorn-engine-3d/wiki).

A demo game, the Linux Kinetic Combat Action Simulator, is included
with the source for Blackthorn 3D.

Initial development for this project was sponsored by
[UCSD's CSE 125 course](http://pisa.ucsd.edu/cse125/)
during spring 2011.

Blackthorn 3D *does not* supersede the old
[Blackthorn 2D game engine](https://bitbucket.org/elliottslaughter/blackthorn-engine). If
you want 3D, use Blackthorn 3D; if you want 2D, use Blackthorn 2D. The
APIs do not overlap. At this time there is no plan to integrate them.
